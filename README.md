# Dependency problem SSCCE

The [sbt-dependency-submission workflow](https://github.com/scalacenter/sbt-dependency-submission) finds dependencies that we wouldn't expect, and that we don't find generated by sbt's own `dependencyTree` command.

This is a problem because we are using this workflow to detect vulnerabilities in GitHub via Dependabot and we are seeing vulnerabilities for software dependencies that we don't believe are part of our build.

## Our problem

This project is a minimal reproduction of the issue. It is a simple Scala project with no dependencies, and we include both the sbt-dependency-submission workflow plugin and sbt's own dependency-tree plugin.

As we'd expect, sbt's `dependencyTree` command produces a nearly empty dependency tree, as we can see in [dependency_tree.txt](dependency_tree.txt).

However, the [sbt-dependency-submission](sbt_dependency_submission_workflow.json) file includes several other dependencies, including the Scala library at version `2.13.12`. As well as the fact that this doesn't appear in the dependency tree output, this finding is unexpected because the project uses Scala `3.4.2`.

## To reproduce

We've checked in files that contain the results of dumping the dependency trees seen by both the sbt dependency tree plugin and the sbt-dependency-submission workflow plugin.
These files can be regenerated by running the script provided in this repository [generate_dependency_trees.sh](generate_dependency_trees.sh).
